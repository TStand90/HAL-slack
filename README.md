# HAL for Slack
A simple bot for Slack, which utilizes the [Real Time Messaging API](https://api.slack.com/rtm) to send and receive messages in real time.

So far, HAL can do the following.
* Say hello
* Get weather information for a specified area
* Tell you the "quote of the day"

But please, don't tell him to open the pod door or try shutting him down.
